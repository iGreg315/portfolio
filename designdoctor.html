            <p>
                In my quest to improve my skills as a graphic designer, I stumbled upon the film, <em>Design Is One</em>, a documentary about the life and work of Massimo &amp; Lella Vignelli, a husband and wife who were both designers in multiple disciplines, and I was so inspired by Massimo's motto: "If you can design one thing, you can design anything." This was the beginning of a significant shift in my attitude towards my work as a graphic designer and truly my purpose in life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started realizing that, as Steve Jobs once said, <em>"Design is not just how it looks and feels; design is how it works."</em> I went from trying to keep up with the latest trends and making things that looked "impressive" to focusing more on function and thinking about how the principles of design could and should be applied to everything from government to putting away your groceries.
            </p>
            <p>
                My plan for this new passion is to create a multidisplinary design firm, but for now I've created this Instagram account, Design Doctor, to share principles of good design and also to "diagnose" design problems I see in my every day life.
